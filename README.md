- Protected routes validate and authorize users via JWT.

### ✅ MongoDB Integration  
- All user data (username, password, email, etc.) is stored in MongoDB.
- MongoDB collection used to persist login credentials and associated information.
- Queries to fetch user profiles securely from the database.
